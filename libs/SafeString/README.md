# SafeString
This SafeString library is designed for beginners to be a safe, robust and debuggable replacement for string processing in Arduino and provides non-blocking text I/O and parsing and testing for Real World use.

This library includes:-  
* **SafeString**, a safe, robust and debuggable replacement for string processing in Arduino  
* **SafeStringReader**, a non-blocking tokenizing text reader replacement for Serial read()  
* **BufferedOutput**, non-blocking replacement for Serial print()  
* **SafeStringStream**, a stream to provide test inputs for repeated testing of I/O sketches   
* **BufferedInput**, extra buffering for text input  
* **loopTimer**, to track of the maximum and average run times for the loop()  
* **millisDelay**, a non-blocking delay replacement, with single-shot, repeating, restart and stop facilities.
